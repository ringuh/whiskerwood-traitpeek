# Uploading TraitPeek to the Steam Workshop

Whiskerwood has no in-game uploader; the scripts use Valve's SteamCMD (`E:\modding\steamcmd\steamcmd.exe`).

1. In the modkit, run **Cook & Install** on `Content/Mods/TraitPeek`.
2. Double-click **`sync-from-modkit.bat`** in the repo root. It copies the assets into `Mod/TraitPeek/`
   and stages `TraitPeek.pak` + `TraitPeek.uplugin` into `workshop/content/` (git-ignored).
   (`./sync-from-modkit.sh --release` in Git Bash does the same.)
3. Update `"changenote"` in `TraitPeek.vdf` (and `"Version"` in `Mod/TraitPeek/TraitPeek.uplugin`).
4. Double-click **`sync-to-steam.bat`**. It logs in as `pienirinkula` (SteamCMD asks for the password /
   Steam Guard code if it has no saved login) and uploads with `workshop_build_item`.
5. The first upload writes the new item id into `"publishedfileid"` in the .vdf - commit that change,
   and check the item's visibility on its Workshop page. Later updates: same steps, new changenote.
